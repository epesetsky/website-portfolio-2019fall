My Work, All in One Place

Hello everyone. Here I have created my own website (which I am very proud of) that displays my writing and design pieces I have created over the last few years at Pitt. I want to be able to show future employers all that I can do writing and design wise, and even post it up on my own site I have created myself. The site is a pure form of who I am in every way. Instead of fitting a mold someone else has made to show my work, I am able to do this on a platform I have created, giving the viewer a little more insight into who I am. Enjoy!
